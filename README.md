# Stone-Crawler-PLUS

A turn-based RPG using an engine I've been working on for almost a year now 
which is coded in C++ using the SDL2 library and the SDL_image, SDL_ttf, and
SDL_mixer extensions to help with audio, text, and png handling.

For now this code is primarily for windows but in the future I'm looking to
port it over to other systems obviously when I make more progress on development.

This does not come with the resources (images, audio, etc.) used to fully compile the game.
